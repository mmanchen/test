# Bulldogs

In this page, I will provide information about Bulldogs, specifically about English and American bulldogs. 

## Ontology
* Each bulldog has a type (name)
* Each bulldog has a personality trait (regarding temperament and socialization) 

## Taxonomy
* Type (American Bulldogs)
	* Johnson Bulldog
	* Scott Bulddog 
* Type (English Bulldog) 
* Personality
  * Temperament
  * Socialization
* Size

## Coreography
I chose to present the elements that are grouped together before so that it would provide meaning and contrast in the F-pattern. Therefore, both of the American bulldogs are presented first and both of the personality traits in the other subpage are presented first.

## Z-Pattern
* 1st Quadrant - Logo so that the user can always return to the main screen, this is usually the place where the logo is located
* 2nd Quadrant - Newsletter Sign Up, not the main goal of the page but secondary goal, this place is not the main focus 
* 3rd Quadrant - Catch phrase not a very strong part of the page so just add a phrase that is not too important
* 4th Quadrant- navigation menu, usually where the nav menu is located so user can go to next pages
* Middle - title and subtitle, positioned in the middle because it is the focal point of the page

## F-Pattern
* Types Page
  * American Bulldogs
    * Images - on the left to call user's attention
    * Title and text - on the right to point directly to the image being referenced
  * English Bulldogs
    * Image - on the right to provide contrast to American Bulldogs image
    * Title and text - on the left to provide contrast to American Bulldogs Page
    
 * Characteristics Page
  * Personality
    * Images - on the left to call user's attention
    * Title and text - on the right to point directly to the image being referenced
  * Size
    * Image - on the right to provide contrast to American Bulldogs image
    * Title and text - on the left to provide contrast to American Bulldogs Page
    
 ## C.R.A.P Principles
 * Contrast - both of the subpages present contrast between the first section and second section. For example, the Types page presents contrast between American and English bulldogs to show that these types of bulldogs are NOT the same. 
              There are different colors, placement of elemtents, and border layouts.
 * Repetition - If we take the two subpages both have exactly the same structure. This is done to show that the second section in these pages is the one different from the previous one. 
 * Proximity - If we take each section of the subpages there is some space between the images and the text but not so much, this is to show that the title and the text make reference or point out to that image next to these elements. 
 
 ## Font
 I used Mansalva font for important texts such as titles and subtitles. I tried out different texts and this one was very readeble and fun to read. It reminded me a lot about bulldogs since they are such a sociable dog breed.
 For paragraphs and other texts I used Hammershmith, I used this text because it came as recommended by Google Fonts when using Mansalva. These two fonts were recommneded togehter. It is very readable and elegant. 
 
 ## CSS Architecture
 Since I used the Z-pattern and F-pattern I used 2 different stylesheets for each of these type of pages. In my html I had separated everything into sections which made it easier to adjust on the CSS. I took each of this sections and made design choices with the CSS. 
 
 ## Php Includes
 * Menu Bar 
 * Scripts for menu highlighter
